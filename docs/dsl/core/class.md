# Class Step

While a `Class` is not a canonical element of hypermedia, some of the more feature-rich
media types, such as Kevin Swiber's [SIREN](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren) and
[Hydra](http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/) offer an additional piece of information to quickly
tell one resource representation from another by introducing `class` metadata.

## Remarks

A class is only valid at top-level.

## Example
